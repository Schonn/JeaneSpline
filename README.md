Thank you for downloading an experimental implementation of Jeane Spline, aliased 'Empathy' during development.

Empathy uses similar concepts to Jeane Spline. However, Empathy uses editable motion paths made from bezier curves and is much faster to apply than baking the movement of empties. 

Empathy will be merged with Jeane Spline as version 1.0.8 if it is successful.
