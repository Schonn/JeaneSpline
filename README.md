Thank you for downloading an experimental version of Jeane Spline Blender 2.8, including features recommended by Allen Grippin!
Included in this version of Jeane Spline is a feature to automatically create influence keyframes for animations intended to loop, without needing to wait for the looping animation feature to process. In addition, a safety feature for avoiding an error caused by hidden empties.
